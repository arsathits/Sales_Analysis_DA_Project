Data Analyst Portfolio Project â€“ Sales Analysis

Business Request & User Stories

The primary business request for this project was to develop an executive sales report tailored for sales managers and representatives. Based on the requirements, specific user stories were defined to ensure the delivery met the business needs and acceptance criteria. These user stories guided the project execution and aligned the deliverables with user expectations.

To fulfill the request:
1.	Sales Managers needed a high-level dashboard overview of internet sales, enabling them to monitor customer and product performance effectively. This was achieved through a Power BI dashboard that updates daily with relevant KPIs and visualizations.
2.	Sales Representatives required detailed views of sales by customers and products, allowing them to identify high-value customers and best-selling products. These dashboards include filtering options for deeper analysis of individual customers and products.
3.	Additionally, Sales Managers wanted to track sales performance over time against budget. This requirement was met by incorporating graphs and KPIs that compare actual sales with budgeted targets, providing actionable insights for strategic planning.
These dashboards were designed to be interactive, visually engaging, and updated daily to ensure data accuracy and relevance.

Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)

To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.
1. Dim_Date
2. Dim_Customers
3. Dim_Products
4. Fact_InternetSales

One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.
